 * fix terminate to only work if root orders it
 * factor active users into queue.c:jl_fits_hl()
 * factor available memory into queue.c:jl_fits_hl()
 * implement load master/server from running state/dirs
 * Check point and restore / migration from host to host
     maybe use proj/netsrc/criu
 

Done
====

 * pid cache now stats for mtime, reloads if not 
   current.  can kill/end/restart server and pid cache
   will allow reestablish of communication.
 * implement security function via pid files.  Each
   server generates a random 64 and stores it in a pid
   file in an nfs shared dir.  setuid root client reads
   it to send packets to server with proper number.
 * list should show time / uid
 * delete / list should use submission hostname + dirname
 * plum job group jq=decimalnumber for -e -l -d
   a way for user to organize jobs.  not used by
   scheduler
   
 * improve delete job
    + make sure it works for job running on master host
    + add job search modes
